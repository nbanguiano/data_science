The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.*\u201d\n",

After analyzing traffic flows in their stores (computer vision), a big box retailer realized that less than 10% of customers visiting their shoe department engaged with the self-service wall display where merchandise was stacked. The culprit turned out to be a series of benches placed in front of the wall, limiting customer access. By relocating the benches to increase accessibility, sales in the department increased by double digits.\n",
      "+ Marketing. A restaurant chain wanted to understand the whether or not sponsoring a local music festival had a measurable impact on customer visits. By capturing data on 15,000 visitors passing through the festival entrances (wireless beacons) and comparing it to customers who visited their restaurants two months prior to the festival and two weeks after, they concluded the festival resulted in 1,300 net new customer visits.\n",
      "+ Operations. A grocery store chain used location analytics to understand customer wait times in various departments and check-out registers. This data not only enabled the company to hold managers accountable for wait times, but it gave additional insight into (and justification for) staffing needs for each department throughout the day and optimal times to perform disruptive tasks such as restocking shelves or resetting displays.\n",
      "+ Strategy. A regional clothing chain was concerned that opening an outlet store would cannibalize customers from its main stores. After analyzing the customer base visiting each store, they discovered that less than 2% of their main store customers visited their outlet.

In many cases anonymous and/or aggregated data can still provide a lot of insight. But it will be important to understand what is and isn\u2019t allowed.

It is important to think about the impact of people knowing about your use of their data.

Similarly, the example of Target, the US Retailer, using analytics to identify pregnant women[2] crossed these boundaries.\n"
